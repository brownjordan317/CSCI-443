    "This notebook will be used to develop and test a model for analyzing and predicting the flow of traffic. This will involve data visualization, feature selection, and baseline comparison. The final intent for the dataloader is that this method will be able to take information from our object detection dataset and use that train local traffic systems on an ever increasing dataset. This will hopefully allow for improved traffic flow and a better understanding of the area for future city planning.\n",
