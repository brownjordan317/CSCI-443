# CSCI-443
This project aims to improve the efficiency of traffic and utilization of road space within any urban environment.

Growing cities and population sizes can lead to civil design needing to be updated. One such case is the operation of traffic lights. Many traffic lights operate entirely on timing systems to determine traffic flow. This is suitable for small and predictable areas, but busy intersections often need to be backed up due to efficient traffic flow. This project aims to minimize such inefficiencies by using an object detection network to track traffic numbers and a data analysis network to determine the most efficient traffic patterns to follow.

    <summary><b>datasets</b></summary>

#### Purpose

This directory hosts the dataset(s) that will be used in this project. It is likely that due to the dataset size, a .txt or other file type describing where to obtain the dataset will hold the place of the dataset. We will do this rather than leaving it blank for the purpose of documentation
